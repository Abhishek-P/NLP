Step1: Cleaning
	For hashtags - the hash was removed, if the tag was in camelcase it was split into words.
	URLs were removed with regex
	Extra symbols were removed during post-tokenization traversal
	All of text was converted to lower case
	Tokens were stremmed and lemmatized
	Tokens were stringified in a space seperated manner
	
Step 2: Vocabulary and Threshold
    Vocabulary was constructed as a dictionary of words:count
	Words with count below a threshold - set low ( 2 ) were replaced by a stopper string
	
Step 3: Trigram,Similarity
    Trigrams were generated
	For the selected word pairs
	Similarity was calculated as given in point 9-12
